Misc notes from emails and such
----------------------------------------------
From Matthew:
Yes. This is exactly the situation I described in my email a while
ago. We want to edit the post-commit hook to automatically update a
public working copy.

If people want, they can use my strip_svn_dirs and strip_path_dirs
functions to quickly remove the .svn directories from their matlab
paths (not that it does any real harm to leave them in; it just slows
down searching the path). Or, we could just do an svn export instead
of an svn update. It won't have the .svn directories, but it also
won't know anything about which dirs/files are updated, so it'll
export the whole thing every time.
