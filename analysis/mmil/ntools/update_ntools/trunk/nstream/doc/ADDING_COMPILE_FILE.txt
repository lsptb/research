To add a C program to the build, you need to add the name of the file to the CMakeList.txt in that directory.  

 - To add the file named mynewfile to trunk/misc/preproc:

SET(mynewfile_SRCS
   mynewfile.c
)
add_executable(mynewfile ${mynewfile_SRCS})
install(TARGETS nspike_preproc
    mynewfile
$$ The rest of the files $$
    DESTINATION bin)

 - To add the file named mynewmexfile.c to trunk/misc/mex:

set (MEXFILES 
    mynewmexfile
$$ The rest of the files $$
)

Don't forget to include a .m file for the documentation

 - The same procedures apply to the mex functions for each module.  Check
    the CMakeLists.txt in each directory.
