FieldTrip is a Matlab toolbox for MEG and EEG analysis that is being
developed at the F.C. Donders Centre (FCDC) together with collaborating
institutes.

The toolbox includes algorithms for simple and advanced analysis
of MEG and EEG data, such as time-frequency analysis, source
reconstruction using dipoles, distributed sources and beamformers
and non-parametric statistical testing. It supports the data formats
of all major MEG systems (CTF, Neuromag, 4D/BTi) and of the most popular
EEG systems, and new formats can be added easily. FieldTrip contains
high-level functions that you can use to construct your own analysis
protocol in Matlab. Furthermore, it easily allows developers to
incorporate low-level algorithms for new EEG/MEG analysis methods.

The FieldTrip software is free but copyrighted software, distributed
