% FieldTrip is a Matlab toolbox for MEG/EEG analysis that is being
% developed by the F.C. Donders Centre (FCDC) in Nijmegen, the
% Netherlands. The toolbox includes algorithms for simple and complex
% analysis of MEG and EEG data, such as time-frequency analysis,
% source reconstruction using dipoles and beamformers and non-parametric
% statistical testing. It supports various file formats, and new
% formats can be added easily
