===========================================

Building
========

Prerequsites: This program requires the libxml2-dev and libxml2 packages to
be installed.

Type "make."

Usage
=====

./edfconvert hdrxmlfile

The converter will produce a file with the same name as the binary input file
with an edf extension.  The following values are used in the EDF header and
can be tweaked at the top of edfconvert.h:

/* defaults for main header */
#define EH_DEFAULT_VERSION "0" 
#define EH_DEFAULT_START_DATE "01.01.70"
#define EH_DEFAULT_START_TIME "00.00.00" 

/* defaults for signal header */
#define EH_S_DEFAULT_TRANSDUCER	"Active electrode"
#define EH_S_DEFAULT_PHYS_DIM "uV"
#define EH_S_DEFAULT_PHYS_MIN "-3276"
#define EH_S_DEFAULT_PHYS_MAX "3276" 
#define EH_S_DEFAULT_DIG_MIN "-32768" 
#define EH_S_DEFAULT_DIG_MAX "32767" 
#define EH_S_DEFAULT_PREFILTER "No Filter" 
#define EH_S_DEFAULT_RESERVED "" 

Notes
=====

The EDF data record length is hardcoded to 1/10th of a second.  This seems
reasonable.  It can be changed in edfconvert.h if needbe.

Bugs
====

The EDF file length is truncated to floor(duration).

There are a lot of places where memory is not freed.  If anyone ever wants to
convert this to a program which runs over multiple files, they'll need to free
the XML data structures, and the EDF header data structures.  In it's current
form, where it is run once per file, it is fine.
